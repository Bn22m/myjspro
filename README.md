myjspro

Uses AngularJS, NodeJS and MySQL.
AngularJS focuses on the frontend side, while NodeJS 
focuses on the backend side. MySQL is used for database 
management.

To start the app we need the database. The SQL file is at 
the db folder. We can use the MySQL Command Line Client to 
create the database and the tables. Once done we can start 
the app by using Node.js command prompt.

cd pathTo/myjspro
node index.js
The app will be running at localhost.
Use the browser to view the project.
